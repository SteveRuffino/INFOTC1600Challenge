Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

I feel like some emojis. ðŸ˜ 

:mad: is not one

ðŸ˜„

Can I highlight an emoji? Let's see: ==ðŸ”«==. I guess ==not==. Wait I can't figure out how to highlight. 

I think that's all I have for you unless I can do a definition.

term
: definition

I don't think that's how it works.
